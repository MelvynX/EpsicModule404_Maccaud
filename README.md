# Ticket0_flask

## Motivation 🏃‍♂️

I made this during a project at Epsic.
It was requested to use Flask for the backend and I decided to use JS with JQuery and Bootstrap 🍓 to make the frontend.

I never really used Bootstrap and JQuery so it was a first time for me!

## Installation

### Backend

To run this project you need to use `Pycharm` 🐍.

Go and the settings here :

Select `venv` and install the dependency.

To start, open `run.py` in pycharm and click on the green arrow ✅➡️.

### Fronted

run in the root of project :
```bash
cd app/yarn

npm i # 🔆 
# or
yarn # 🐳 
```
It's done.
