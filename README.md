# Ticket0_flask

## Motivation 🏃‍♂️

This project was done during a test at epsic.
It was requested to use Flask for the backend and I decided to use JS with JQuery and Bootstrap 🍓 to make the frontend.

I really never use Bootstrap and JQuery so it was a firt time for me!

## Installation

Select `venv` and install the dependency.

To start, open `run.py` in pycharm and clic in the green arrow ✅➡️.

### Fronted

run :
```bash
cd app/yarn

npm i # 🔆 
# or
yarn # 🐳 
```
It's done.
